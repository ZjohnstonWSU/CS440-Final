# Team 10 AI Chess Bot

An application in which a user plays against an AI chess bot

# How to run

In a Python-enabled environment and in the project's working directory, type 'python src/main.py' to boot game.

# Game notes

Currently, program is in a multiplayer (human v human) mode in which players take turns playing for black and white. Upon player win, the winner is displayed on the window to the right, and no more moves can be made on the board.

Additionally, pawn promotions lead only to queens, but future implementations might allow for picking which piece to promote to.
